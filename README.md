# Java-Game
This is a basic game I made using Java. The Galaga name was mearly a placeholder that never got changed. 
This project utalizes many advanced programming features such as: Objects and Interfaces (The enemy ships, for example, are objects that use an interface that all moving objects in game use), Multiplyer capability through TCP on LAN, and of course graphical interface made from scratch. 

Galaga.jar is the final compiled game and can be downloaded and excecuted. The game can be excecuted on any platfor that has the Java JRE installed.

Tested platforms include: Windows XP/ 7/ 8/ 10 (x86/x64), Mac OS X (x64), Ubuntu (x86), Raspian on a Pi Zero (Armv6).
